# student_mark_pridiction
Project Overview This project is a web application built using Flask that predicts a student's marks based on the number of study hours per day. The model is trained using machine learning algorithms and is deployed in a Flask web app. The application takes user input for the number of study hours and predicts the marks that the student is l

#Features
User Input: Takes the number of study hours as input.
Prediction: Predicts the percentage marks based on the study hours.
Data Persistence: Stores the user inputs and predictions in a CSV file for future analysis.
Real-time Prediction: Makes predictions on-the-fly using a pre-trained machine learning model.
Error Handling: Handles invalid input and shows error messages to users.

#Technologies Used
Flask: A lightweight Python web framework used to build the web application.
Joblib: Used for loading the pre-trained machine learning model.
NumPy: For handling numerical operations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and saving the predictions in a CSV file.
HTML/CSS: For building the user interface.

#Requirements
Ensure that the following libraries are installed:

Flask
Joblib
NumPy
Pandas
